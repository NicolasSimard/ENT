# L-function experiments

## Description
This directory contains computations related to L-functions in general. For example, it contains examples of computations related to Dirichlet L-functions.

## A remark on the Hecke L-function of imaginary quadratic fields
The `ENT/lfunc/quadhecke.gp` script is an implementation of the formulas in my notes `Notes/Theta Norm`. To compute with these L-function it is preferable to use the function `qhcLdata` in the script `ENT/Quadratic.gp` and use the built-in L-functions functions.
