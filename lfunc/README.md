#L-function experiments

This directory contains computations related to L-functions in general. So far,
it contains a scripts that defines the Dedekind zeta function of a number field.
Soon, it will contain examples of Dirichlet L-functions (of quadratic characters,
for example) and of Hilbert L-functions (L-functions of characters of class
groups of number fields).
