#L-function experiments

This directory contains computations related to L-functions in genral. So far, it contains a scripts that defines the Dedekind zeta fuction of a number field.
Soon, it will contain examples of Dirichlet L-functions (of quadratic characters,
for example) and of Hilbert L-functions (L-funcitons of characters of class
groups of number fields). Examples of Weber L-functions (L-fucntions of
characters of ray class groups of number fields) are in progress. All this
should culminate in examples of Hecke L-functions (L-functions of Hecke
characters, generalising all of the above examples).

The ultimate goal is to numerically evaluate Hecke L-functions of Hecke
characters of imaginary quadratic fields of infinity type (2k,0) in order to
implement a formula of DLR that evaluates the Pettersson norm of certain theta
series attached to the quadratic field (see DLR paper).
