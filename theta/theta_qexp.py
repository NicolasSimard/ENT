"""This script can be called from the command line as follows:
1) With 3 arguments: > python theta_qexp.py M k N
This prints the q-expansions of all the theta series of parameter k attached
to the ideal classes of the fields of prime discriminant less than M in
absolute value. Only the first N coefficients are computed.

2) With 4 arguments: > python theta_qexp.py M k N file.txt
This command is similar to the previous one, except that the results are
printed in file.txt.

    Given a quadratic form, return a list of length N, where the nth entry is

    One can also verifiy that using different representatives in the ideal
    class (i.e. choosing equivalent forms) gives proportional q-expansions.

    Examples:
