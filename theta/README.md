# theta
This is where all the computations with theta functions take place. The main
script is Thetapip.gp, which defines a bunch of functions to efficiently compute
the Petersson inner product of binary theta series attached to imaginary quadratic
fields. A detailed presentation of the formulas that are used in Thetapip.gp can
be found in the NicolasSimard/Notes/ repo.
