# Computations for PhD Thesis
The 'comps/' folder contains small scripts that execute various computations, often related to my PhD thesis.

_Disclaimer_: Those scripts are often not commented, sometimes obscure and may not provide accurate results. They are mainly used to save me some time if I wish to redo or improve a relatively elaborate computation in the future.

## List of computations
### August
- august-28th-2017: Check that the symmetric square L-function of theta series factors as a product of a Dirichlet L-series and a Hecke L-function. Check also the formula the Petersson norm of theta series in terms of special values of Hecke L-functions.

### June
- june-26th-2017: Verify numerically the p-adic interpolation formulas for small discriminant and prime.
- june-16th-2017-2: Verify numerically the formulas giving the derivatives of the level one Eisenstein series of weight 2, 4 and 6.
- june-16th-2017: Check if the elliptic curve provided by PARI from a singular j-invariant is defined over the relevant class field.
- june-02-2017: Comparing the algebraic delta modular form with the discriminant function of elliptic curves.

### May
- may-31st-2017: Verify numerically that the CM values of E2, as defined in the thesis, are algebraic when normalized by a suitable period.
- may-27th-2017: Test the can period function by verifying that it can be used to make CM values of modular forms algebraic.
- may-25th-2017: Experiment to find the period attached to a fractional ideal in an imaginary quadratic field.
- may-01-2017: See if the quantities that appear in the log in the weight one formula are algebraic, in relation with Stark's remark.

### April
- april-28th-2017-2: Nicer script to test Starks's remark for all imaginary quadratic fields of class number 3. It is true.
- april-28th-2017: Compute the invariants defined in the thesis for imaginary quadratic fields.
- april-27th-2017-2: Test Starks's remark for all imaginary quadratic fields of class number 5. It seems like the remark doesn't hold...
- april-27th-2017: Test Starks's remark for all imaginary quadratic fields of class number 3.
- april-24th-2017: Computations to try to attach a familly of invariants to imaginary quadratic fields. We eventually find the invariant defined in the thesis!
- april-13th-2017: Experiment with Lang's statements in Chapter 12 of his book 'Elliptic functions'.
- april-6th-2017: Compute the twisted symmetric square L-function of theta series.

### March
- march-24th-2017: Compare our implementation of the algorithm to compute the Petersson norm of theta series with the one using special values of the Hecke L-function. The data attached to the L-function is computed using the qhcLdata function.
- march-16th-2017: Check if 'Delta(ida)/Delta(ida*idp^-1)' is a unit, where ida and idp are ideals in imaginary quadratic fields.
